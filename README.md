# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm m18cz

I'm currently learning **GLua** to develop my own Garry's Mod server and custom addons.  
I already know the basics of **Lua**, and now I'm focusing on applying that knowledge to the Garry's Mod environment.

Right now, I'm working on building my own server and creating mods from scratch. My goal is to understand how everything works under the hood and eventually run a stable, customized experience.

## ðŸ”§ What I'm using

- **GLua** â€“ actively learning
- **Lua** â€“ basic knowledge
- **Blender** â€“ just starting out, experimenting with models
